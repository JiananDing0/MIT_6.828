## Exercise 2
```make gdb``` actually requires us to start 2 terminal pages. We need first run ```make qemu-gdb``` in one terminal page, until we see the following information shows up on the screen:
```
***
*** Now run 'make gdb'.
***
```
After that, we can then run ```make gdb``` on the other terminal page, and follow the instructions to explore.
Also, if the following error information shows up when you try to run "make gdb":
```
gdb -n -x .gdbinit
make: gdb: No such file or directory
make: *** [gdb] Error 1
```
Please check the **Environment Setting** part of [README.md](https://github.com/JiananDing0/MIT_6.828/blob/master/README.md) on the first page of this repository.


#### Process of booting:
* BIOS(Basic input/output system) is first reached. It located at physical address 0xffff0. It initializes some basic settings such as VGA display. Then it searches for bootable disk.
* Bootable disk has boot sector (512 bytes). A sector is the disk's minimum transfer granularity. When it is find the BIOS will load the 512 bytes to physical address 0x7c00 to 0x7dff.
* The control then passed to boot loader.
* In order to understand boot loader, the comment in file ```boot/main.c``` helps a lot:
```
/**********************************************************************
 * This a dirt simple boot loader, whose sole job is to boot
 * an ELF kernel image from the first IDE hard disk.
 *
 * DISK LAYOUT
 *  * This program(boot.S and main.c) is the bootloader.  It should
 *    be stored in the first sector of the disk.
 *
 *  * The 2nd sector onward holds the kernel image.
 *
 *  * The kernel image must be in ELF format.
 *
 * BOOT UP STEPS
 *  * when the CPU boots it loads the BIOS into memory and executes it
 *
 *  * the BIOS intializes devices, sets of the interrupt routines, and
 *    reads the first sector of the boot device(e.g., hard-drive)
 *    into memory and jumps to it.
 *
 *  * Assuming this boot loader is stored in the first sector of the
 *    hard-drive, this code takes over...
 *
 *  * control starts in boot.S -- which sets up protected mode,
 *    and a stack so C code then run, then calls bootmain()
 *
 *  * bootmain() in this file takes over, reads in the kernel and jumps to it.
