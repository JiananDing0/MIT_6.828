## Exercise 6
Before we start this exercise, I am going to go through the code at ```boot/main.c``` to better understand this lab. The link to corresponding code is [here](https://github.com/JiananDing0/MIT_6.828/blob/master/lab1/boot/main.c). 
* ```outb``` function: Based on descriptions from [Linux Manual Page], the definition of ```outb``` function can be either ```void outb(unsigned char value, unsigned short int port)``` or ```void outb(unsigned short int port, unsigned char value)```
