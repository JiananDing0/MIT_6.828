# The UNIX Operating System

### A Unix system is made up of 3 layers:

  - Kernel: The center of the system that controls the resourses of the machine
  - Shell: Wrapped around the kernel. An interface between users and the kernel
  - Utilities: Programs build by people based on the system functions

### Advantages of UNIX System:

* Pipelining
> A bunch of programs connected end-to-end. Data flow through the programs for the final result. The system looks at the synchronization to make sure the data go through the process. However, the programs themselves cannot recognize this.
* File System
> A hierarchy of directories. Directory is basically a file that either contains other directories or files.
