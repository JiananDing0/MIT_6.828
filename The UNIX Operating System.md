## The UNIX Operating System

A Unix system is made up of 3 layers:

  - Kernel: The center of the system that controls the resourses of the machine
  - Shell: Wrapped around the kernel. An interface between users and the kernel
  - Utilities: Programs build by people based on the system functions

Advantages of UNIX System:
1. Pipelining:
> A bunch of programs connected end-to-end. Data flow through the programs for the final result
